## 🎓 Advanced Techniques Explained

### 1. **Multi-Head Attention**
Instead of single attention, the model uses 4 attention heads:
- Each head learns different patterns
- Head 1: Short-term trends
- Head 2: Long-term trends
- Head 3: Volatility patterns
- Head 4: Volume-price relationships

### 2. **Positional Encoding**
Since Transformers don't inherently understand order:
- Adds sinusoidal position information
- Even indices: sin(position / 10000^(2i/d))
- Odd indices: cos(position / 10000^(2i/d))
- Allows model to understand temporal relationships

### 3. **Wavelet Decomposition**
Think of it as looking at stock prices through different lenses:
- **Level 0 (Approximation)**: Long-term trend
- **Level 1 (Detail)**: Monthly patterns
- **Level 2 (Detail)**: Weekly patterns
- **Level 3 (Detail)**: Daily noise

### 4. **Fourier Analysis**
Detects repeating cycles:
- Earnings cycles (quarterly)
- Option expiration cycles
- Seasonal patterns
- Market manipulation patterns

### 5. **Sentiment Integration**
Combines multiple sentiment sources:
```
Final Sentiment = (0.6 × News Sentiment) + (0.4 × Social Sentiment)
```
- News: More reliable, slower to change
- Social: More reactive, higher volatility
- Weighted to balance both
