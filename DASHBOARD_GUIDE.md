## üìä Understanding Results

### Metrics Explained

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- Average prediction error in dollars
- Lower is better
- Typical: $1-5 for stable stocks

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Similar to MAE but penalizes large errors more
- Lower is better
- Usually slightly higher than MAE

**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
- Error as a percentage
- Lower is better
- Good: <10%, Excellent: <5%

**Directional Accuracy**
- Percentage of correct trend predictions
- >50% is better than random
- Good: >60%, Excellent: >70%

**Confidence Score**
- Overall prediction reliability
- High: >80%, Medium: 60-80%, Low: <60%
- Based on multiple factors

### Interpreting Charts

**Actual vs Predicted**
- Blue line: Historical actual prices
- Orange line: Model predictions
- Green line: Future forecast
